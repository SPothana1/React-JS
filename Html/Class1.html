      BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Tuesday said AAP National
      Convenor Arvind Kejriwal and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee proposed Congress
      President Mallikarjun Kharge's name as the opposition INDIA bloc's prime
      ministerial candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections to "oust" Rahul
      Gandhi from the race. Banerjee and Kejriwal on Tuesday proposed Kharge's
      name as the opposition INDIA bloc's prime ministerial candidate after a
      meeting in Delhi, saying he can be the country's "first Dalit prime
      minister" but no decision has been taken on it.
